# MendelU-Algoritmizace
Here you can find my solutions of MendelU projects including tests, compilations and descriptions.

## Contributions
If you want to contribute new project or solution create new folder which will include following files:
 - **main.cpp** - file which will get compiled by GCC
 - **README.md** - description of problem being solved + expected result
 - **test.sh** - bash script which will perform some test operations and output result to stdout + return 0 if succesful
 - **optional test data**
